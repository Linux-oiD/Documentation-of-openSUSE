 <para>

  <ulink
   url="http://www.docbook.org"/>). The XML source files were
  validated by <command>xmllint</command>, processed by
  <command>xsltproc</command>, and converted into XSL-FO using a customized
  version of Norman Walsh's stylesheets. The final PDF is formatted through
  XEP from RenderX.<phrase
   os="osuse"> The open source tools and the
  environment used to build this manual are available in the package
  <systemitem
    class="resource">susedoc</systemitem> that is shipped with
