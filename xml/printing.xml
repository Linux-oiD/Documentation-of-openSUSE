  &productnamereg; supports printing with many types of printers, including
  remote network printers. Printers can be configured manually or with
  &yast;. For configuration instructions, refer to

  CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) is the standard print system in
  &productname;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Printers can be distinguished by interface, such as USB or network, and
  printer language. When buying a printer, make sure that the printer has an
  interface (like USB or parallel port) that is available on your hardware
  and a suitable printer language. Printers can be categorized on the basis
  of the following three classes of printer languages:

   <term>PostScript Printers</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     PostScript is the printer language in which most print jobs in Linux
     and Unix are generated and processed by the internal print system. If
     PostScript documents can be processed directly by the printer and do
     not need to be converted in additional stages in the print system, the
     number of potential error sources is reduced.

   <term>Standard Printers (Languages Like PCL and ESC/P)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Although these printer languages are quite old, they are still
     undergoing expansion to address new features in printers. In the case
     of known printer languages, the print system can convert PostScript
     jobs to the respective printer language with the help of Ghostscript.
     This processing stage is referred to as interpreting. The best-known
     languages are PCL (which is mostly used by HP printers and their
     clones) and ESC/P (which is used by Epson printers). These printer
     languages are usually supported by Linux and produce an adequate print
     result. Linux may not be able to address some special printer
     functions. Except for HP developing HPLIP (HP Linux Imaging and
     Printing), there are currently no printer manufacturers who develop
     Linux drivers and make them available to Linux distributors under an
     open source license.

  <title>The Workflow of the Printing System</title>

  <para>
   The user creates a print job. The print job consists of the data to print
   plus information for the spooler, such as the name of the printer or the
   name of the printer queue, and optionally, information for the filter,
   such as printer-specific options.
  </para>

  <para>
   At least one dedicated printer queue exists for every printer. The
   spooler holds the print job in the queue until the desired printer is
   ready to receive data. When the printer is ready, the spooler sends the
   data through the filter and back-end to the printer.
  </para>

  <para>
   The filter converts the data generated by the application that is
   printing (usually PostScript or PDF, but also ASCII, JPEG, etc.) into
   printer-specific data (PostScript, PCL, ESC/P, etc.). The features of the
   printer are described in the PPD files. A PPD file contains
   printer-specific options with the parameters needed to enable them on the
   printer. The filter system makes sure that options selected by the user
   are enabled.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you use a PostScript printer, the filter system converts the data into
   printer-specific PostScript. This does not require a printer driver. If
   you use a non-PostScript printer, the filter system converts the data
   into printer-specific data. This requires a printer driver suitable for
   your printer. The back-end receives the printer-specific data from the
   filter then passes it to the printer.

  <title>Installing the Software</title>

  <para>
   PPD (PostScript printer description) is the computer language that
   describes the properties, like resolution, and options, such as the
   availability of a duplex unit. These descriptions are required for using
   various printer options in CUPS. Without a PPD file, the print data would
   be forwarded to the printer in a <quote>raw</quote> state, which is
   usually not desired. During the installation of &productname;, many PPD
   files are preinstalled.
  </para>

  <para>
   To configure a PostScript printer, the best approach is to get a suitable
   PPD file. Many PPD files are available in the package
   <systemitem>manufacturer-PPDs</systemitem>, which is automatically
   installed within the scope of the standard installation. See
   <xref
   linkend="sec.p.special.ppd"/> and

   Be careful if a printer manufacturer wants you to install entire software
   packages. First, this kind of installation may result in the loss of the
   support provided by &productname; and second, print commands may work
   differently and the system may no longer be able to address devices of
   other manufacturers. For this reason, the installation of manufacturer

   A network printer can support various protocols, some of them even
   concurrently. Although most of the supported protocols are standardized,
   some manufacturers modify the standard. Manufacturers then provide
   drivers for only a few operating systems. Unfortunately, Linux drivers
   are rarely provided. The current situation is such that you cannot act on
   the assumption that every protocol works smoothly in Linux. Therefore,
   you may have to experiment with various options to achieve a functional

      as the printer queue. If necessary, the printer manual should indicate
      what name to use. LPT, LPT1, LP1 or similar names are often used. The

   The protocol supported by the printer must be determined before
   configuration. If the manufacturer does not provide the needed
   information, the command <command>nmap</command> (which comes with the
   <systemitem>nmap</systemitem> package) can be used to ascertain the
   protocol. <command>nmap</command> checks a host for open ports. For

   <title>Configuring CUPS with Command Line Tools</title>
   <para>
    CUPS can be configured with command line tools like
    <command>lpinfo</command>, <command>lpadmin</command> and
    <command>lpoptions</command>. You need a device URI consisting of a
    back-end, such as parallel, and parameters. To determine valid device
    URIs on your system use the command <command>lpinfo -v | grep
    ":/"</command>:
   </para>
<screen># lpinfo -v | grep ":/"
direct usb://ACME/FunPrinter%20XL
direct parallel:/dev/lp0
</screen>
   <para>
    With <command>lpadmin</command> the CUPS server administrator can add,
    remove or manage print queues. To add a print queue, use the following

<screen>lpadmin -p <replaceable
  >queue</replaceable> -v <replaceable
  >device-URI</replaceable> -P <replaceable
    >PPD-file</replaceable> -E</screen>
   <para>
    Then the device (<option>-v</option>) is available as
    <replaceable>queue</replaceable> (<option>-p</option>), using the
    specified PPD file (<option>-P</option>). This means that you must know
    the PPD file and the device URI to configure the printer manually.
   </para>
   <para>
    Do not use <option>-E</option> as the first option. For all CUPS
    commands, <option>-E</option> as the first argument sets use of an
    encrypted connection. To enable the printer, <option>-E</option> must be
    used as shown in the following example:

   <para>
    These printers do not support any common printer language and can only
    be addressed with special proprietary control sequences. Therefore they
    can only work with the operating system versions for which the
    manufacturer delivers a driver. GDI is a programming interface developed
    by Microsoft* for graphics devices. Usually the manufacturer delivers
    drivers only for Windows, and since the Windows driver uses the GDI
    interface these printers are also called <emphasis>GDI
    printers</emphasis>. The actual problem is not the programming
    interface, but the fact that these printers can only be addressed with
    the proprietary printer language of the respective printer model.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some GDI printers can be switched to operate either in GDI mode or in
    one of the standard printer languages. See the manual of the printer
    whether this is possible. Some models require special Windows software
    to do the switch (note that the Windows printer driver may always switch
    the printer back into GDI mode when printing from Windows). For other
    GDI printers there are extension modules for a standard printer language
    available.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some manufacturers provide proprietary drivers for their printers. The
    disadvantage of proprietary printer drivers is that there is no
    guarantee that these work with the installed print system or that they
    are suitable for the various hardware platforms. In contrast, printers
    that support a standard printer language do not depend on a special
    print system version or a special hardware platform.
   </para>
   <para>
    Instead of spending time trying to make a proprietary Linux driver work,
    it may be more cost-effective to purchase a printer which supports a
    standard printer language (preferably PostScript). This would solve the
    driver problem once and for all, eliminating the need to install and
    configure special driver software and obtain driver updates that may be
    required due to new developments in the print system.

      Troubleshooting a Network Printer or Print Server Box
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Spoolers running in a print server box sometimes cause problems when
       they have to deal with multiple print jobs. Since this is caused by
       the spooler in the print server box, there no way to resolve this
       issue. As a work-around, circumvent the spooler in the print server
       box by addressing the printer connected to the print server box
       directly with the TCP socket. See <xref linkend="sec.p.net"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
       In this way, the print server box is reduced to a converter between
       the various forms of data transfer (TCP/IP network and local printer
       connection). To use this method, you need to know the TCP port on the
       print server box. If the printer is connected to the print server box
       and turned on, this TCP port can usually be determined with the
       <command>nmap</command> utility from the
       <systemitem>nmap</systemitem> package some time after the print
       server box is powered up. For example, <command>nmap
       <replaceable>IP-address</replaceable></command> may deliver the
       following output for a print server box:
      </para>
<screen>Port       State       Service
23/tcp     open        telnet
80/tcp     open        http

631/tcp    open        cups

      <para>
       This output indicates that the printer connected to the print server
       box can be addressed via TCP socket on port <literal>9100</literal>.
       By default, <command>nmap</command> only checks a number of commonly
       known ports listed in
       <filename>/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services</filename>. To check all
       possible ports, use the command <command>nmap

    For the print system, the print job is completed when the CUPS back-end

    If a CUPS network server broadcasts its queues to the client hosts via

    client hosts, the client <command>cupsd</command> accepts print jobs
    from applications and forwards them to the <command>cupsd</command> on
    the server. When <command>cupsd</command> on the server accepts a print
    job, it is assigned a new job number. Therefore, the job number on the
    client host is different from the job number on the server. As a print
    job is usually forwarded immediately, it cannot be deleted with the job
    number on the client host This is because the client
    <command>cupsd</command> regards the print job as completed as soon as
    it has been forwarded to the server <command>cupsd</command>.

    When it becomes desirable to delete the print job on the server, use a
