 <title>&aa; Profile Repositories</title>
 <para>
  &aa; ships a set of profiles enabled by default and created by the &aa;
  developers, and kept under the <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>. In
  addition to these profiles,
  <phrase
   os="sles;sled;osuse">&productname;</phrase><phrase os="slert">&slert;</phrase>
  ships profiles for individual applications together with the relevant
  application. These profiles are not enabled by default, and reside under
  another directory than the standard &aa; profiles,
  <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</filename>.
 </para>
 <para>
  &aa; also supports the use of an external profile repository. This
  repository is maintained by Novell and allows you to download profiles
  generated by Novell and other &aa; users as well as uploading your own.
  Find the profile repository at
  <ulink url="http://apparmor.opensuse.org"/>.
 </para>
 <sect1 id="sec.apparmor.repos.local">
  <title>Using the Local Repository</title>

  <para>
   The &aa; tools (&yast; and aa-genprof and aa-logprof) support the use of
   a local repository. Whenever you start to create a new profile from
   scratch, and there already is one inactive profile in your local
   repository, you are asked whether you would like to use the existing
   inactive one from <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</filename> and
   whether you want to base your efforts on it. If you decide to use this
   profile, it gets copied over to the directory of profiles enabled by
   default (<filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>) and loaded whenever &aa;
   is started. Any further further adjustments will be done to the active
   profile under <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>.

  <title>Using the External Repository</title>

  <remark>TODO: Content missing for SLES/SLED, please fix</remark>

  <para>
   The external &aa; profile repository at
   <ulink url="http://apparmor.opensuse.org"/> serves two main purposes:
   Allowing users to either browse and download profiles created by other
   users and uploading their profiles to be able to easily use them on
   different machines. A valid login on the profile repository server is
   required for uploading profiles. Simply downloading profiles from the
   server does not require a login.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Using the &aa; Profile Repository</title>
   <para>
    When using the profile repository in your deployment, keep in mind that
    the profiles maintained in the repository are primarily targeted at
    profile developers and might probably need fine-tuning before they suit
    your particular needs. Please test the downloaded profiles extensively
    before deploying them to your live setup, and adjust them if necessary.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.apparmor.repos.external.init">
   <title>Setting up Profile Repository Support</title>
   <para>
    Once properly configured, both the &yast; and the command line tools
    support the use of an external profile repository. The initial
    configuration takes place when you start the &yast; Add Profile Wizard,
    the Update Profile Wizard, aa-genprof, or aa-logprof to create or update
    a profile that already exists on the repository server:
   </para>
   <procedure>

     <para>
      Determine whether or not to use the profile repository.

    <step>
     <para>
      Enable the repository for profile downloads.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Once you have created or modified a profile, determine whether the
      tools need to be able to upload your profile to the repository.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you choose to upload profiles to the repository, enter your
      credentials for the repository server.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>
    The configuration of the repository is done by editing two configuration
    files, <filename>/etc/apparmor/logprof.conf</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/apparmor/respository.conf</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <filename>/etc/apparmor/logprof.conf</filename> file contains a
    section called <literal>[repository]</literal>.
    <literal>distro</literal> determines the version of &productname; used
    on your system for which the &aa; tools need to search profiles on the
    server. <literal>url</literal> holds the server URL and
    <literal>preferred_user</literal> tells the &aa; tools to prefer
    profiles created by the <literal>novell</literal> user. Those profiles
    were created, tested and approved by members of the &suse; development
    team.

   <para>
    The <filename>/etc/apparmor/repository.conf</filename> file is created
    during the configuration process with the &aa; tools. It contains your
    authentication data and specifies which actions to enable with regards
    to the profile repository. If you opt for profile download and do not
    want to be able to upload your own profiles <literal>enabled</literal>
    is set to <literal>yes</literal> while <literal>upload</literal> is set

   <title>Downloading a Profile</title>
   <para>
    While creating a profile from scratch or updating an existing profile by
    processing reject messages in the log, the &aa; tools search the
    repository for a matching profile. If the search is successful, the
    profile or the list of profiles is displayed and you can view them and
    choose the one that best matches your setup. As soon as you have chosen
    a profile, it gets copied to the local machine (to the
    <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename> directory) and activated.
    Alternatively, you can choose to ignore the profile on the repository
    and create your own one from scratch.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.apparmor.repos.external.update">
   <title>Uploading Your own Profile</title>
   <para>
    After a profile has been created or updated, the &aa; tools that a
    profile also present in the repository has been changed or that a new
    one has been created. If your system is configured to upload profiles to
    the repository, you are prompted to provide a ChangeLog to document your
    changes before the changes are uploaded to the server. These changes are
    only synched to the repository, but not to the creator of the original
    profile.
