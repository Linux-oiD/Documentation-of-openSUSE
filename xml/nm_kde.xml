   plasmoid-networkmanagement is the default on 11.4; ignoring k&nm; for now
   since there is no time to describe both.
   If k&nm; documentation is added again, nm.xml needs to be adjusted, too.

   In sections that apply to both programs I am using "&nm; front-end" or
   the "&nm; icon".

  The KDE front-end for &nm; is the K&nm; applet.

  The KDE front-end for &nm; is the &nm; plasmoid. If the network has been
  set up for &nm; control, the plasmoid usually starts automatically with
  the desktop environment and is shown as an icon in the system tray.

  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the applet
  is probably not started. Press <keycombo><keycap function="alt"/>
  <keycap>F2</keycap> </keycombo> and enter
  <command>knetworkmanager</command> to start it manually.
 </para>
-->

 <para>
  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the
  plasmoid is probably not started. Click on the <guimenu>Panel Tool
  Box</guimenu> and choose <guimenu>Add Widgets</guimenu>. Double-click on
  the <guimenu>Network Management</guimenu> entry and click on the
  <guimenu>Panel Tool Box</guimenu> again.
 </para>

 <para>
  The &nm; front-end only shows wireless networks for which you have
  configured a connection. It hides connections when you are out of range of
  a wireless network, or when the network cable is disconnected, thus always
  giving you a clear view of which connections may be used.
