  <title>Views for Searching Packages or Patterns</title>
  <para>
   The easiest way to find a package is to use the search field in the upper
   right corner of the software manager. Enter a search term and press
   <keycap function="enter"/>. By default it will search package names and
   summaries. Press the search item to change this filter and search the
   file lists, for example.
  </para>
  <para>
   The software manager also offers different views and filters for
   displaying package lists. These are available from the pull-down menu in
   the upper left corner:

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Groups</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The default view lists all packages sorted by groups such as
      <guimenu>Admin Tools</guimenu>, <guimenu>Graphics</guimenu>,

      clicking on repository names. The <quote>pseudo repository</quote>
      <guimenu>@System</guimenu> lists all packages currently installed.

    Certain packages are dependent on other packages, such as shared

 <sect2 id="sec.y2.sw.gtk.deps">
  <title>Checking Software Dependencies</title>
  <para>
   Most packages are dependent on other packages. If a package, for example,
   uses a shared library, it will be dependent on the package providing this
   library. On the other hand, some packages cannot coexist with each other,
   causing a conflict (for example, you can only install one mail transfer
   agent: sendmail or postfix). When installing or removing software, the
   Software Manager makes sure no dependencies or conflicts remain
   unresolved to ensure system integrity.
  </para>
  <para>
   In case there exists only one solution to resolve a dependency or a
   conflict, it is resolved automatically. Multiple solutions always cause a
   conflict which needs to be resolved manually. If solving a conflict
   involves a vendor or architecture change, it also needs to be solved
   manually. When clicking <guimenu>Apply</guimenu> to apply any changes in
   the Software Manager, you get an overview of all actions triggered by the
   automatic resolver which you need to confirm.
  </para>
  <para>
   By default, dependencies are automatically checked. A check is performed
   every time you change a package status (for example, by marking a package
   for installation or removal). This is generally useful, but can become
   exhausting when manually resolving a dependency conflict. To disable this
   function, uncheck <menuchoice> <guimenu>Dependencies</guimenu>
   <guimenu>Autocheck</guimenu> </menuchoice>. Manually perform a dependency
   check with <menuchoice> <guimenu>Dependencies</guimenu> <guimenu>Check
   Now</guimenu></menuchoice>. A consistency check is always performed when
   you confirm your selection with <guimenu>Apply</guimenu>.
  </para>
  <note>
   <title>Manually Solving Package Conflicts</title>
   <para>
    Unless you are very experienced, follow the suggestions &yast; makes
    when handling package conflicts, otherwise you may not be able to
    resolve them. Keep in mind that every change you make, potentially
    triggers other conflicts, so you can easily end up with a steadily
    increasing number of conflicts. In case this happens, click
    <guimenu>Cancel</guimenu> and <guimenu>Quit</guimenu> the software
    manger. Relaunch it to start again.
