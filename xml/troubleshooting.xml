   Linux reports things in a very detailed way. There are several places to
   look when you encounter problems with your system, most of which are
   standard to Linux systems in general, and some of which are relevant to
   &productname; systems. Most log files can be viewed with &yast;

   Log</guimenu> </menuchoice>).

    <para>
     On some older computers, there is no bootable DVD drive available, but
     there is a floppy disk drive present. To install on such a system,
     create boot disks and boot your system with them.
    </para>
    <para>
     The boot disks include the loader called SYSLINUX and the program
     linuxrc. SYSLINUX enables the selection of a kernel during the boot
     procedure and the specification of any parameters needed for the
     hardware used. The program linuxrc supports the loading of kernel
     modules for your hardware and subsequently starts the installation.
    </para>
    <para>
     When booting from a boot disk, the boot procedure is initiated by the
     boot loader SYSLINUX (package <systemitem>syslinux</systemitem>). When
     the system is booted, SYSLINUX runs a minimum hardware detection that
     mainly consists of the following steps:

      <para>
       The first block of the first hard disk (MBR) is read to map BIOS IDs
       to Linux device names during the boot loader configuration. The
       program attempts to read the block by means of the the lba32
       functions of the BIOS to determine if the BIOS supports these
       functions.

     Linux supports most existing DVD drives. If the system has neither a
     DVD drive nor a floppy disk, it is still possible that an external DVD
     drive, connected through USB, FireWire, or SCSI, can be used to boot
     the system. This depends mainly on the interaction of the BIOS and the
     hardware used. Sometimes a BIOS update may help if you encounter
     problems.

    One reason why a machine does not boot the installation media can be an
    incorrect boot sequence setting in BIOS. The BIOS boot sequence must
    have DVD drive set as the first entry for booting. Otherwise the machine
    would try to boot from another medium, typically the hard disk. Guidance
    for changing the BIOS boot sequence can be found the documentation
    provided with your motherboard, or in the following paragraphs.
   </para>
   <para>
    The BIOS is the software that enables the very basic functions of a
    computer. Motherboard vendors provide a BIOS specifically made for their
    hardware. Normally, the BIOS setup can only be accessed at a specific
    time&mdash;when the machine is booting. During this initialization
    phase, the machine performs a number of diagnostic hardware tests. One
    of them is a memory check, indicated by a memory counter. When the
    counter appears, look for a line, usually below the counter or somewhere
    at the bottom, mentioning the key to press to access the BIOS setup.
    Usually the key to press is one of <keycap>Del</keycap>,
    <keycap>F1</keycap>, or <keycap>Esc</keycap>. Press this key until the
    BIOS setup screen appears.

    from the X server as it attempted to start. If the desktop fails during

   Many problems of your system may be network-related, even though they do
   not seem to be at first. For example, the reason for a system not
   allowing users to log in may be a network problem of some kind. This
   section introduces a simple check list you can apply to identify the
   cause of any network problem encountered.

    When checking the network connection of your machine, proceed as

     If you use an ethernet connection, check the hardware first. Make sure
     that your network cable is properly plugged into your computer and
     router (or hub, etc.). The control lights next to your ethernet
     connector are normally both be active.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the connection fails, check whether your network cable works with
     another machine. If it does, your network card causes the failure. If
     hubs or switches are included in your network setup, they may be
     faulty, as well.

     administrator.

     Once you have checked your basic network connectivity, try to find out
     which service is not responding. Gather the address information of all
     network servers needed in your setup. Either look them up in the
     appropriate &yast; module or ask your system administrator. The

        network servers for authentication and these servers cannot be found
        due to name resolution issues, users would not even be able to log
