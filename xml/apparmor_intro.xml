 <title>Introducing &aa;</title>
 <para>
  Many security vulnerabilities result from bugs in
  <emphasis>trusted</emphasis> programs. A trusted program runs with
  privileges that attackers would like to have. The program fails to keep
  that trust if there is a bug in the program that allows the attacker to
  acquire said privilege.
 </para>
 <para>
  &naareg; is an application security solution designed specifically to
  apply privilege confinement to suspect programs. &aa; allows the
  administrator to specify the domain of activities the program can perform
  by developing a security <emphasis>profile</emphasis> for that application
  (a listing of files that the program may access and the operations the
  program may perform). &aa; secures applications by enforcing good
  application behavior without relying on attack signatures, so it can
  prevent attacks even if previously unknown vulnerabilities are being
  exploited.
