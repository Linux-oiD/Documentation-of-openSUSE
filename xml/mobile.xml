 <abstract>
  <para>
   Mobile computing is mostly associated with laptops, PDAs and cellular
   phones (and the data exchange between them). Mobile hardware components,
   such as external hard disks, flash drives, or digital cameras, can be
   connected to laptops or desktop systems. A number of software components
   are involved in mobile computing scenarios and some applications are
   tailor-made for mobile use.

  <para>
   The hardware of laptops differs from that of a normal desktop system.
   This is because criteria like exchangeability, space requirements and
   power consumption must be taken into account. The manufacturers of mobile
   hardware have developed standard interfaces like PCMCIA (Personal
   Computer Memory Card International Association), Mini PCI and Mini PCIe
   that can be used to extend the hardware of laptops. The standards cover
   memory cards, network interface cards, ISDN (and modem cards) and
   external hard disks.

   <title>&productname; and Tablet PCs</title>

    &productname; also supports Tablet PCs. Tablet PCs come with a
    touchpad/digitizer that allows you to use a digital pen or even
    fingertips to edit data right on the screen instead of using mouse and
    keyboard. They are installed and configured much like any other system.
    For a detailed introduction to the installation and configuration of
    Tablet PCs, refer to <xref

       SCPM (system configuration profile management) allows storage of
       arbitrary configuration states of a system into a kind of
       <quote>snapshot</quote> called a <emphasis>profile</emphasis>.
       Profiles can be created for different situations. They are useful
       when a system is operating in changing environments (home network,
       office network). It is always possible to switch between profiles. To
       get SCPM up and running on your system, install the package
       <systemitem class="resource">scpm</systemitem>. Enable SCPM using the
       &yast; Profile Management module and configure the users that should
       be allowed to switch profiles without the need of entering the
       &rootuser; password. Determine whether profile changes should survive
       a system reboot or whether they should be discarded upon shutdown.
       Make sure all resource groups (i.e. services like network and
       printer, for example) are active. Proceed to creating actual profiles
       using <command>scpm</command> command line tool. Refer to the
       <systemitem>scpm</systemitem> man page for details. Create profiles
       for all the different setups you want to use this system in.
       Switching between profiles can either be done on the running system
       via <command>scpm switch
       <replaceable>PROFILENAME</replaceable></command> or at system boot
       time via the <keycap>F3</keycap> key. When switching profiles, SCPM
       automatically adjusts your system configuration to the new
       environment laid out in the profile you have chosen.

       Under KDE, a GUI for <systemitem>scpm</systemitem> is available. Make

        access the Internet. Devices called <emphasis>access

        act as intermediaries for access to the Internet. A mobile user can
        switch among access points depending on location and which access

        computers (laptops) and PDAs or cellular phones, as can IrDA. It can

        also used to connect wireless system components, like a keyboard or

        application of IrDA is the transmission of a file from a laptop to a
        cellular phone. The short path from the laptop to the cellular phone
        is then covered using IrDA. The long range transport of the file to
        the recipient of the file is handled by the mobile network. Another
        application of IrDA is the wireless transmission of printing jobs in
        the office.

       Important data should not only be encrypted during transmission, but
       also on the hard disk. This ensures its safety in case of theft. The
       creation of an encrypted partition with &productname; is described in
       <xref linkend="cha.security.cryptofs"/>. Another possibility is to
       create encrypted home directories when adding the user with &yast;.

   flexible handling of mobile hardware items. To unmount any of these media

      As soon as an external hard disk is correctly recognized by the
      system, its icon appears in the file manager. Clicking the icon
      displays the contents of the drive. It is possible to create folders
      and files here and edit or delete them. To rename a hard disk from the
      name it had been given by the system, select the corresponding menu
      item from the menu that opens when the icon is right-clicked. This
      name change is limited to display in the file manager. The descriptor
      by which the device is mounted in <filename>/media</filename> remains
      unaffected by this.
