  &nm; is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. It
  supports state-of-the-art encryption types and standards for network
  connections, including connections to 802.1X protected networks. 802.1X is
  the <quote>IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area
  Networks&mdash;Port-Based Network Access Control</quote>. With &nm;, you
  do not need to worry about configuring network interfaces and switching
  between wired or wireless networks when you are moving. &nm; can
  automatically connect to known wireless networks or manage several network
  connections in parallel&mdash;the fastest connection is then used as
  default. Furthermore, you can manually switch between available networks
  and manage your network connection using an applet in the system tray.

  Instead of only one connection being active, multiple connections may be
  active at once. This enables you to unplug your laptop from an Ethernet

   &nm; distinguishes two types of wireless connections, trusted and

   selected in the past. All others are untrusted. Trusted connections are
   identified by the name and MAC address of the access point. Using the MAC
   address ensures that you cannot use a different access point with the
   name of your trusted connection.

      By default, connections in &nm; are device type-specific: they apply
      to all physical devices with the same type. If more than one physical
      device per connection type is available (for example, your machine is
      equipped with two ethernet cards), you can tie a connection to a
      certain device.
<!-- by explicitly specifying the hardware address (or MAC
      address) of the device-->

     <para>
      To do so in GNOME, first look up the MAC address of your device by

      network connections and choose the connection you want to modify. On

      In case a DHCP server provides invalid DNS information (and/or

      The GNOME and KDE &nm; applets start automatically if the network is
      set up for &nm; control. If the applet does not start, check if &nm;
      is enabled in &yast; as described in
      <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/>. Then make sure that the appropriate
      package for your desktop environment is also installed. If you are
      using KDE 4, the package is
      <systemitem
