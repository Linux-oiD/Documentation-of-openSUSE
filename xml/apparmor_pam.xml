 <para>
  An &aa; profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the
  program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the
  program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as
  a subprofile. The pam_apparmor PAM module allows applications to confine
  authenticated users into subprofiles based on group names, user names, or
  a default profile. To accomplish this, pam_apparmor needs to be registered
  as a PAM session module.

  The package pam_apparmor may not installed by default, you may need to
  install it using &yast; or <command>zypper</command>. Details about how to
  set up and configure pam_apparmor can be found in
  <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/pam_apparmor/README</filename> after the
  package has been installed. For details on PAM, refer to

  pam_apparmor allows you to set up role-based access control (RBAC). In
  conjunction with the set capabilities rules (see
  <xref
   linkend="sec.apparmor.profiles.set_capabilities"/> for more
  information), it allows you to map restricted admin profiles to users. A
  detailed HOWTO on setting up RBAC with &aa; is available at
  <ulink
