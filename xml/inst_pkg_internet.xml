 <title>Installing Packages From the Internet</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   By default, it is only possible to install packages from configured and
   enabled repositories. Apart from the official repositories that are
   configured during the installation, numerous other repositories exist.
   The &opensusereg; Build Service hosts several hundred ones and a lot of
   third party repositories exist, too&mdash;see
   <ulink
    url="http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   &productname; offers two easy ways to install from these repositories
   without the need to first subscribe to them. The <literal>1-Click
   Install</literal> method allows you to install packages directly from a
   Web browser, while the &yast; Package Search lets you query almost all
   known repositories for &productname;. You can directly install any
   package found by the package search module.
