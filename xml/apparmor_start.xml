  <title>Choosing the Applications to Profile</title>

  <para>
   You only need to protect the programs that are exposed to attacks in your
   particular setup, so only use profiles for those applications you
   actually run. Use the following list to determine the most likely
   candidates:
  </para>

<?dbfo-need height="10em"?>

  <simplelist>
   <member>Network Agents</member>
   <member>Web Applications</member>
   <member>Cron Jobs</member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>
   To find out which processes are currently running with open network ports
   and might need a profile to confine them, run
   <command>aa-unconfined</command> as &rootuser;.
  </para>

  <example id="ex.unconfined">
   <title>Output of <command>aa-unconfined</command></title>
<screen>19848 /usr/sbin/cupsd not confined

19947 /usr/lib/postfix/master not confined
29205 /usr/sbin/sshd confined by '/usr/sbin/sshd (enforce)'</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
   Each of the processes in the above example labeled <literal>not
   confined</literal> might need a custom profile to confine it. Those
   labeled <literal>confined by</literal> are already protected by &aa;.

  <title>Building and Modifying Profiles</title>

  <para>
   &naa; on &productname; ships with a preconfigured set of profiles for the
   most important applications. In addition, you can use &aa; to create your
   own profiles for any application you want.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are two ways of managing profiles. One is to use the graphical
   front-end provided by the &yast; &naa; modules and the other is to use
   the command line tools provided by the &aa; suite itself. Both methods
   basically work the same way.
  </para>

  <para>
   For each application, perform the following steps to create a profile:
  </para>

  <procedure id="proc.genprof">
   <step id="st.genprof1">
    <para>
     As &rootuser;, let &aa; create a rough outline of the application's
     profile by running <command>aa-genprof

     application you want to profile.
    </para>
    <para>
     A basic profile is outlined and &aa; is put into learning mode, which
     means that it logs any activity of the program you are executing, but
     does not yet restrict it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step id="st.genprof2">
    <para>
     Run the full range of the application's actions to let &aa; get a very
     specific picture of its activities.

     following the instructions given in the wizard until the profile is
     completed.
    </para>
    <para>
     &aa; scans the logs it recorded during the application's run and asks
     you to set the access rights for each event that was logged. Either set
     them for each file or use globbing.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Depending on the complexity of your application, it might be necessary
     to repeat <xref
      linkend="st.genprof2"/> and
     <xref linkend="st.genprof3"/>. Confine the application, exercise it
     under the confined conditions, and process any new log events. To
     properly confine the full range of an application's capabilities, you
     might be required to repeat this procedure often.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step id="st.genprof4">
    <para>
     Once all access permissions are set, your profile is set to enforce
     mode. The profile is applied and &aa; restricts the application
     according to the profile just created.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you started aa-genprof on an application that had an existing
     profile that was in complain mode, this profile remains in learning
     mode upon exit of this learning cycle. For more information about
     changing the mode of a profile, refer to
     <xref linkend="sec.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.complain"/>
     and
     <xref
      linkend="sec.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.enforce"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   Test your profile settings by performing every task you need with the
   application you just confined. Normally, the confined program runs
   smoothly and you do not notice &aa; activities at all. However, if you
   notice certain misbehavior with your application, check the system logs
   and see if &aa; is too tightly confining your application. Depending on
   the log mechanism used on your system, there are several places to look
   for &aa; log entries:
  </para>

  <simplelist>
   <member><filename>/var/log/audit/audit.log</filename>
   </member>
   <member><filename>/var/log/messages</filename>
   </member>
   <member><filename>dmesg</filename>
   </member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>
   To adjust the profile, analyze the log messages relating to this
   application again as described in <xref linkend="st.genprof3"/>.
   Determine the access rights or restrictions when prompted.
