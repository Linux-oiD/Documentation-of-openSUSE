 <para>
  In GNOME, &nm; can be controlled with the GNOME &nm; applet. If the
  network is set up for &nm; control, the applet usually starts
  automatically with the desktop environment and is shown as an icon in the
  system tray.
 </para>

 <para>
  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the applet
  is probably not started. Press &altf2; and enter
  <command>nm-applet</command> to start it manually.

    <para>
     Left-click the applet icon to show a menu with available networks. The

   the menu. Encrypted wireless networks are marked with a lock icon.

     an entry from the list of available wireless networks.

    <para>
     If the network is encrypted, a dialog opens. It shows the type of

     and authentication settings. Enter the appropriate credentials.

     To connect to a network that does not broadcast its service set
     identifier ((E)SSID) and therefore cannot be detected automatically,
