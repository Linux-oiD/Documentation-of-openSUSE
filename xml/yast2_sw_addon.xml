  <para>
   Add-on products are system extensions. You can install a third party
   add-on product or a special system extension of &productnamereg; (for
   example, a CD with support for additional languages or a CD with binary
   drivers). To install a new add-on, start &yast; and select <menuchoice>
   <guimenu>Software</guimenu> <guimenu>Add-On Products</guimenu>
   </menuchoice> . You can select various types of product media, like CD,
   FTP, USB mass storage devices (such as USB flash drives or disks) or a
   local directory. You can work also directly with ISO files. To add an
   add-on as ISO file media, select <guimenu>Local ISO Image</guimenu> then
   enter the <guimenu>Path to ISO Image</guimenu>. The <guimenu>Repository
   Name</guimenu> is arbitrary.
