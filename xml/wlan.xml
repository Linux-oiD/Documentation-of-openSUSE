 toms 2009-09-15 (openSUSE 11.2):
 Migrated wlan.xml from sect1 into a chapter as this time only wlan.xml 
 is available in wireless.xml (discussed with Frank).
 This is a bit too less for a single sect1.
 In case, we support/have more time for the other files in the next
 release, enable the corresponding files in wireless.xml and migrate this
 chapter into a section again (or decide otherwise).

   Wireless LANs, or Wireless Local Area Network (WLANs), have become an
   indispensable aspect of mobile computing. Today, most laptops have
   built-in WLAN cards. This chapter describes how to set up a WLAN card
   with &yast;, encrypt transmissions, and use tips and tricks.

  <para>
   WLAN cards communicate using the 802.11 standard, prepared by the IEEE
   organization. Originally, this standard provided for a maximum
   transmission rate of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s. Meanwhile, several supplements have
   been added to increase the data rate. These supplements define details
   such as the modulation, transmission output, and transmission rates (see
   <xref
    linkend="tab.wireless.std.overview"/>). Additionally, many
   companies implement hardware with proprietary or draft features.

  <title>Operating Modes</title>

  <para>
   In wireless networking, various techniques and configurations are used to
   ensure fast, high-quality, and secure connections. Different operating
   types suit different setups. It can be difficult to choose the right
   authentication method. The available encryption methods have different
   advantages and pitfalls.
  </para>

  <para>
   Basically, wireless networks can be classified into three network modes:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Managed Mode (Infrastructure Mode), via Access Point </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Managed networks have a managing element: the access point. In this
      mode (also referred to as infrastructure mode), all connections of the
      WLAN stations in the network run through the access point, which may
      also serve as a connection to an ethernet. To make sure only
      authorized stations can connect, various authentication mechanisms
      (WPA, etc) are used.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Ad-hoc Mode (Peer-to-Peer Network)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Ad-hoc networks do not have an access point. The stations communicate
      directly with each other, therefore an ad-hoc network is usually
      faster than a managed network. However, the transmission range and
      number of participating stations are greatly limited in ad-hoc
      networks. They also do not support WPA authentication. If you are
      intending to use WPA security, then you should not use Ad-Hoc_Mode.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Master Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In master mode your network card is used as the access point. It works
      only if your WLAN card supports this mode. Find out the details of
      your WLAN card on <ulink

 <sect1 id="sec.wireless.wlan.func.auth">
  <title>Authentication</title>

  <para>
   Because a wireless network is much easier to intercept and compromise
   than a wired network, the various standards include authentication and
   encryption methods. In the original version of the IEEE 802.11 standard,
   these are described under the term WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy).
   However, because WEP has proven to be insecure (see
   <xref
    linkend="sec.wireless.wlan.tant.sec"/>), the WLAN industry
   (joined under the name <emphasis>Wi-Fi Alliance</emphasis>) has defined
   an extension called WPA, which is supposed to eliminate the weaknesses of
   WEP. The later IEEE 802.11i standard includes WPA and some other
   authentication and encryption methods. IEEE 802.11i is also referred to
   as WPA2, because WPA is based on a draft version of 802.11i.
  </para>

  <para>
   To make sure that only authorized stations can connect, various
   authentication mechanisms are used in managed networks:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>None (Open)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      An open system is a system that does not require authentication. Any
      station can join the network. Nevertheless, WEP encryption can be
      used, see <xref linkend="sec.wireless.wlan.func.encr"/>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Shared Key (according to IEEE 802.11)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In this procedure, the WEP key is used for the authentication.
      However, this procedure is not recommended, because it makes the WEP
      key more susceptible to attacks. All an attacker needs to do is to
      listen long enough to the communication between the station and the
      access point. During the authentication process, both sides exchange
      the same information, once in encrypted form and once in unencrypted
      form. This makes it possible for the key to be reconstructed with
      suitable tools. Because this method makes use of the WEP key for the
      authentication and for the encryption, it does not enhance the
      security of the network. A station that has the correct WEP key can
      authenticate, encrypt, and decrypt. A station that does not have the
      key cannot decrypt received packets. Accordingly, it cannot
      communicate, regardless of whether it had to authenticate itself.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>WPA-PSK (or WPA-Personal, according to IEEE 802.1x)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      WPA-PSK (PSK stands for preshared key) works similarly to the Shared
      Key procedure. All participating stations as well as the access point
      need the same key. The key is 256 bits in length and is usually
      entered as a passphrase. This system does not need a complex key
      management like WPA-EAP and is more suitable for private use.
      Therefore, WPA-PSK is sometimes referred to as WPA
      <quote>Home</quote>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>WPA-EAP (or WPA-Enterprise, according to IEEE 802.1x)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Actually, WPA-EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) is not an
      authentication system but a protocol for transporting authentication
      information. WPA-EAP is used to protect wireless networks in
      enterprises. In private networks, it is scarcely used. For this
      reason, WPA-EAP is sometimes referred to as WPA
      <quote>Enterprise</quote>.
     </para>
     <para>
      WPA-EAP needs a Radius server to authenticate users. EAP offers three
      different methods for connecting and authenticating to the server:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS): TLS authentication relies on the
        mutual exchange of certificates for both server and client. First,
        the server presents its certificate to the client where it is
        evaluated. If the certificate is considered valid, the client in
        turn presents its certificate to the server. While TLS is secure, it
        requires a working certification management infrastructure in your
        network. This infrastructure is rarely found in private networks.

        Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP-PEAP): Both TTLS
        and PEAP are two-stage protocols. In the first stage, a secure
        connection is established and in the second the client
        authentication data is exchanged. They require far less
        certification management overhead than TLS, if any.

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>WEP (defined in IEEE 802.11)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This standard makes use of the RC4 encryption algorithm, originally
      with a key length of 40&nbsp;bits, later also with 104&nbsp;bits.
      Often, the length is declared as 64&nbsp;bits or 128&nbsp;bits,
      depending on whether the 24&nbsp;bits of the initialization vector are
      included. However, this standard has some weaknesses. Attacks against
      the keys generated by this system may be successful. Nevertheless, it
      is better to use WEP than to not encrypt the network at all.
     </para>
     <para>
      Some vendors have implemented the non-standard <quote>Dynamic
      WEP</quote>. It works exactly as WEP and shares the same weaknesses,
      except that the key is periodically changed by a key management
      service.

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>TKIP (defined in WPA/IEEE 802.11i)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This key management protocol defined in the WPA standard uses the same
      encryption algorithm as WEP, but eliminates its weakness. Because a
      new key is generated for every data packet, attacks against these keys
      are fruitless. TKIP is used together with WPA-PSK.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>CCMP (defined in IEEE 802.11i)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      CCMP describes the key management. Usually, it is used in connection
      with WPA-EAP, but it can also be used with WPA-PSK. The encryption
      takes place according to AES and is stronger than the RC4 encryption
      of the WEP standard.

    Use the best possible encryption method your hardware allows. However,

    For example, if your router supports both WEP and WPA but the driver for

     For WEP, usually only key is needed&mdash;however, up to 4 different

     For higher security, WPA-EAP uses a RADIUS server to authenticate
     users. For authentication at the server, three different methods are
     available: TLS, TTLS and PEAP. The credentials and certificates you
     need for WPA-EAP depend on the authentication method used for the
     RADIUS server. Ask your system administrator to provide the needed

    The performance and reliability of a wireless network mainly depend on
    whether the participating stations receive a clear signal from the other
    stations. Obstructions like walls greatly weaken the signal. The more
    the signal strength sinks, the more the transmission slows down. During
    operation, check the signal strength with the
    <command>iwconfig</command> utility on the command line (<literal>Link
    Quality</literal> field) or with the &nm; applets provided by KDE or
    GNOME. If you have problems with the signal quality, try to set up the
    devices somewhere else or adjust the position of the antennas of your
    access points. Auxiliary antennas that substantially improve the
    reception are available for a number of PCMCIA WLAN cards. The rate
    specified by the manufacturer, such as 54&nbsp;Mbit/s, is a nominal
    value that represents the theoretical maximum. In practice, the maximum

    If you want to set up a wireless network, remember that anybody within
    the transmission range can easily access it if no security measures are
    implemented. Therefore, be sure to activate an encryption method. All
    WLAN cards and access points support WEP encryption. Although this is
    not entirely safe, it does present an obstacle for a potential attacker.
   </para>
   <para>
    For private use, use WPA-PSK if available. Although Linux supports WPA
    on most hardware components, some drivers do not offer WPA support. It
    may also not be available on older access points and routers with WLAN
    functionality. For such devices, check if WPA can be implemented by
    means of a firmware update. If WPA is not available, WEP is better than
    no encryption. In enterprises with advanced security requirements,
    wireless networks should only be operated with WPA.

    The command <command>iwconfig</command> can give you important
    information about your wireless connection. For example, the following
    line displays the ESSID, the wireless mode, frequency, if you signal is
    encrypted, the link quality, and much more:
   </para>
<screen><command>iwconfig</command> wlan0
wlan0  IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:"guest"
       Mode:Managed   Frequency:5.22GHz  Access Point: 00:11:22:33:44:55
       Bit Rate:54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=13 dBm
       Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
       Encryption key:off
       Power Management:off

       Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
       Tx excessive retries:10  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0</screen>
   <para>
    You can also get the previous information with the
    <command>iwlist</command> command. For example, the following line
    displays the current bit rate:
   </para>
<screen><command>iwlist</command> wlan0 rate
wlan0    unknown bit-rate information.
         Current Bit Rate=54 Mb/s</screen>
   <para>
    If you want an overview how many access points are available, it can
    also be done with the <command>iwlist</command> command. It gives you a
    list of <quote>cells</quote> which looks like this:
   </para>
<screen><command>iwlist</command> wlan0 scanning
wlan0   Scan completed:

    Modern laptops usually have a network card and a WLAN card. If you
    configured both devices with DHCP (automatic address assignment), you
    may encounter problems with the name resolution and the default gateway.
    This is evident from the fact that you can ping the router but cannot
    surf the Internet. The Support Database features an article on this
    subject at
    <ulink
