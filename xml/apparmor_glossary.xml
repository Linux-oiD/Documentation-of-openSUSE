   <term>Apache</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Apache is a freely-available UNIX-based Web server. It is currently the
     most commonly used Web server on the Internet. Find more information
     about Apache at the Apache Web site at
     <ulink url="http://www.apache.org"/>.

  <varlistentry>
   <term>application firewalling</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     &naa; contains applications and limits the actions they are permitted
     to take. It uses privilege confinement to prevent attackers from using
     malicious programs on the protected server and even using trusted
     applications in unintended ways.

  <varlistentry>
   <term>attack signature</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Pattern in system or network activity that alerts of a possible virus
     or hacker attack. Intrusion detection systems might use attack
     signatures to distinguish between legitimate and potentially malicious
     activity.
    </para>
    <para>
     By not relying on attack signatures, &naa; provides "proactive" instead
     of "reactive" defense from attacks. This is better because there is no
     window of vulnerability where the attack signature must be defined for
     &naa; as it does for products using attack signatures to secure their
     networks.
    </para>

   <term>GUI</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Graphical user interface. Refers to a software front-end meant to
     provide an attractive and easy-to-use interface between a computer user
     and application. Its elements include such things as windows, icons,
     buttons, cursors, and scroll bars.

   <term>HIP</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Host intrusion prevention. Works with the operating system kernel to
     block abnormal application behavior in the expectation that the
     abnormal behavior represents an unknown attack. Blocks malicious
     packets on the host at the network level before they can
     <quote>hurt</quote> the application they target.

   <term>mandatory access control</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A means of restricting access to objects that is based on fixed
     security attributes assigned to users, files, and other objects. The
     controls are mandatory in the sense that they cannot be modified by
     users or their programs.

   <term>profile foundation classes</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Profile building blocks needed for common application activities, such
     as DNS lookup and user authentication.

   <term>RPM</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The RPM Package Manager. An open packaging system available for anyone
     to use. It works on Red Hat Linux,
     <phrase os="sles;sled;osuse">&productname;</phrase><phrase os="slert"
      >&slert;</phrase>,
     and other Linux and UNIX systems. It is capable of installing,
     uninstalling, verifying, querying, and updating computer software
     packages. See <ulink
      url="http://www.rpm.org/"/> for more
     information.

  <varlistentry>
   <term>streamlined access control</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     &naa; provides streamlined access control for network services by
     specifying which files each program is allowed to read, write, and
     execute. This ensures that each program does what it is supposed to do
     and nothing else.

   <term>vulnerabilities</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     An aspect of a system or network that leaves it open to attack.
     Characteristics of computer systems that allow an individual to keep it
     from correctly operating or that allows unauthorized users to take
     control of the system. Design, administrative, or implementation
     weaknesses or flaws in hardware, firmware, or software. If exploited, a
     vulnerability could lead to an unacceptable impact in the form of
     unauthorized access to information or the disruption of critical
     processing.
