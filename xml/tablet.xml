  <title>Using Gesture Recognition</title>

   <title>Using CellWriter</title>
   <para>
    <indexterm>
    <primary>Tablet PCs</primary>
    <secondary>CellWriter</secondary>
    </indexterm> With CellWriter, you can write characters into a grid of
    cells&mdash;the writing is instantly recognized on a character basis.
    After you have finished writing, you can send the input to the currently
    focused application. Before you can use CellWriter for gesture
    recognition, the application needs to be trained to recognize your
    handwriting: You need to train each character of a certain map of keys
    (untrained characters are not activated and thus cannot be used).
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <title>Training CellWriter</title>
    <step>
     <para>
      Start CellWriter from the main menu or with
      <command>cellwriter</command> from the command line. On the first
      start, CellWriter automatically starts in the training mode. In
      training mode it shows a set of characters of the currently chosen key
      map.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Enter the gesture you would like to use for a character into the
      respective character's cell. With the first input, the background
      changes its color to white, whereas the character itself is shown in
      light gray. Repeat the gesture multiple times until the character
      changes its color to black. Untrained characters are shown on a light
      gray or brown background (depending on the desktop's color scheme).
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Repeat this step until you have trained CellWriter for all characters
      you need.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      If you want to train CellWriter for another language, click the
      <guimenu> Setup</guimenu> button and select a language from the
      <guimenu>Languages</guimenu> tab. <guimenu>Close</guimenu> the
      configuration dialog. Click the <guimenu>Train</guimenu> button and
      select the key map from the drop-down box at the bottom right corner
      of the <guimenu>CellWriter</guimenu> window. Now repeat your training
      for the new map of keys.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      After having finished the training for the map of keys, click the
      <guimenu>Train</guimenu> button to switch to the normal mode.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>
    In the normal mode, the CellWriter windows shows a couple of empty cells
    in which to enter the gestures. The characters are not sent to another
    application until you click the <guimenu>Enter</guimenu> button, so you
    can correct or delete characters before you use them as input.
    Characters that have been recognized with a low degree of confidence
    will appear highlighted. To correct your input, use the context menu
    that appears on right-clicking a cell. To delete a character, either use
    your pen's eraser, or middle-click with the mouse to clear the cell.
    After finishing your input in CellWriter, define which application
    should receive the input by clicking into the application's window. Then
    send the input to the application by clicking <guimenu>Enter</guimenu>.
