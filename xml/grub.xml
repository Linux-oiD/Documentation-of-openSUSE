 <abstract>
  <para>
   This chapter describes how to configure &grub; (Grand Unified
   Bootloader), the boot loader used in &productnamereg;. A special &yast;
   module is available for configuring all settings. If you are not familiar
   with the subject of booting in Linux, read the following sections to
   acquire some background information. This chapter also describes some of
   the problems frequently encountered when booting with &grub; and their
   solutions.

  <title>No &grub; on machines using UEFI</title>
  <para>
   &grub; will routinely be installed on machines equipped with a
   traditional BIOS and on UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
   machines using a Compatibility Support Module (CSM). On UEFI machines
   without enabled CSM, <systemitem>eLILO</systemitem> will automatically be
   installed (provided DVD1 booted successfully). Refer to the eLILO
   documentation at <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/elilo/</filename> on

 <para>
  This chapter focuses on boot management and the configuration of the boot
  loader &grub;. The boot procedure as a whole is outlined in
  <xref linkend="cha.boot"/>. A boot loader represents the interface between
  the machine (BIOS) and the operating system (&productname;). The
  configuration of the boot loader directly impacts the start of the
  operating system.

    <para>
     The structure of the MBR is defined by an operating
     system&ndash;independent convention. The first 446&nbsp;bytes are
     reserved for the program code. They typically hold part of a boot
     loader program or an operating system selector. The next 64&nbsp;bytes
     provide space for a partition table of up to four entries. The
     partition table contains information about the partitioning of the hard
     disk and the file system types. The operating system needs this table
     for handling the hard disk. With conventional generic code in the MBR,
     exactly one partition must be marked <emphasis>active</emphasis>. The
     last two bytes of the MBR must contain a static <quote>magic
     number</quote> (<literal>AA55</literal>). An MBR containing a different
     value is regarded as invalid by some BIOSes, so is not considered for
     booting.

    <para>
     Boot sectors are the first sectors of hard disk partitions with the
     exception of the extended partition, which merely serves as a
     <quote>container</quote> for other partitions. These boot sectors have
     512&nbsp;bytes of space for code used to boot an operating system
     installed in the respective partition. This applies to boot sectors of
     formatted DOS, Windows, and OS/2 partitions, which also contain some
     basic important data of the file system. In contrast, the boot sectors
     of Linux partitions are initially empty after setting up a file system
     other than XFS. Therefore, a Linux partition is not bootable by itself,
     even if it contains a kernel and a valid root file system. A boot
     sector with valid code for booting the system has the same magic number
     as the MBR in its last two bytes (<literal>AA55</literal>).

  <para>
   &grub; comprises two stages. Stage 1 consists of 512&nbsp;bytes and its
   only task is to load the second stage of the boot loader. Subsequently,
   stage 2 is loaded. This stage contains the main part of the boot loader.
  </para>

  <para>
   In some configurations, an intermediate stage 1.5 can be used, which
   locates and loads stage 2 from an appropriate file system. If possible,
   this method is chosen by default on installation or when initially
   setting up &grub; with &yast;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Stage 2 is able to access many file systems. Currently, ext2, ext3,
   ReiserFS, Minix, and the DOS FAT file system used by Windows are
   supported. To a certain extent, XFS, and UFS and FFS used by BSD systems
   are also supported. Since version 0.95 &grub; is also able to boot from a
   CD or DVD containing an ISO 9660 standard file system pursuant to the
   <quote>El Torito</quote> specification. Even before the system is booted,
   &grub; can access file systems of supported BIOS disk devices (floppy
   disks or hard disks, CD drives and DVD drives detected by the BIOS).
   Therefore, changes to the &grub; configuration file
   (<filename>menu.lst</filename>) do not require a new installation of the
   boot manager. When the system is booted, &grub; reloads the menu file
   with the valid paths and partition data of the kernel or the initial RAM
   disk (<literal>initrd</literal>) and locates these files.
  </para>

  <para>
   The actual configuration of &grub; is based on four files that are
   described below:

      This file is read by the perl-bootloader library which is used when
      configuring the bootloader with &yast; and every time a new kernel is
      installed. It contains configuration options (such as kernel
      parameters) that will be added by default to the bootloader
      configuration file.

  <para>
   &grub; can be controlled in various ways. Boot entries from an existing
   configuration can be selected from the graphical menu (splash screen).
   The configuration is loaded from the file <filename>menu.lst</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   In &grub;, all boot parameters can be changed prior to booting. For
   example, errors made when editing the menu file can be corrected in this
   way. Boot commands can also be entered interactively at a kind of input
   prompt. For details, see <xref linkend="sec.grub.menu.change"/>. &grub;
   offers the possibility of determining the location of the kernel and the
   <filename>initrd</filename> prior to booting. In this way, you can even
   boot an installed operating system for which no entry exists in the boot
   loader configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
   &grub; actually exists in two versions: as a boot loader and as a normal
   Linux program in <filename>/usr/sbin/grub</filename>. The latter is
   referred to as the <emphasis>&grub; shell</emphasis>. It provides an
   emulation of &grub; in the installed system and can be used to install
   &grub; or test new settings before applying them. The functionality to
   install &grub; as the boot loader on a hard disk or floppy disk is
   integrated in &grub; in the form of the command <command>setup</command>.
   This is available in the &grub; shell when Linux is loaded.

   <para>
    The graphical splash screen with the boot menu is based on the &grub;
    configuration file <filename>/boot/grub/menu.lst</filename>, which
    contains all information about all partitions or operating systems that
    can be booted by the menu.
   </para>
   <para>
    Every time the system is booted, &grub; loads the menu file from the
    file system. For this reason, &grub; does not need to be reinstalled
    after every change to the file. Use the &yast; boot loader to modify the
    &grub; configuration as described in
    <xref linkend="sec.boot.yast2.config"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The menu file contains commands. The syntax is very simple. Every line
    contains a command followed by optional parameters separated by spaces
    like in the shell. For historical reasons, some commands permit an
    <literal>=</literal> in front of the first parameter. Comments are
    introduced by a hash (<literal>#</literal>).
   </para>
   <para>
    To identify the menu items in the menu overview, set a
    <literal>title</literal> for every entry. The text (including any
    spaces) following the keyword <literal>title</literal> is displayed as a
    selectable option in the menu. All commands up to the next
    <literal>title</literal> are executed when this menu item is selected.
   </para>
   <para>
    The simplest case is the redirection to boot loaders of other operating
    systems. The command is <literal>chainloader</literal> and the argument
    is usually the boot block of another partition, in &grub; block
    notation. For example:
   </para>
<screen>chainloader (hd0,3)+1</screen>
   <para>
    The device names in &grub; are explained in
    <xref linkend="sec.grub.devices"/>. This example specifies the first
    block of the fourth partition of the first hard disk.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use the command <literal>kernel</literal> to specify a kernel image. The
    first argument is the path to the kernel image in a partition. The other
    arguments are passed to the kernel on its command line.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the kernel does not have built-in drivers for access to the root
    partition or a recent Linux system with advanced hotplug features is
    used, <filename>initrd</filename> must be specified with a separate
    &grub; command whose only argument is the path to the
    <filename>initrd</filename> file. Because the loading address of the
    <filename>initrd</filename> is written into the loaded kernel image, the
    command <literal>initrd</literal> must follow after the
    <literal>kernel</literal> command.
   </para>
   <para>
    The command <literal>root</literal> simplifies the specification of
    kernel and initrd files. The only argument of <literal>root</literal> is
    a device or a partition. This device is used for all kernel,
    <filename>initrd</filename>, or other file paths for which no device is
    explicitly specified until the next <literal>root</literal> command.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <literal>boot</literal> command is implied at the end of every menu
    entry, so it does not need to be written into the menu file. However, if
    you use &grub; interactively for booting, you must enter the
    <literal>boot</literal> command at the end. The command itself has no
    arguments. It merely boots the loaded kernel image or the specified
    chain loader.
   </para>
   <para>
    After writing all menu entries, define one of them as the
    <literal>default</literal> entry. Otherwise, the first one (entry
    <literal>0</literal>) is used. You can also specify a time-out in
    seconds after which the default entry should boot.
    <literal>timeout</literal> and <literal>default</literal> usually
    precede the menu entries. An example file is described in
    <xref
     linkend="sec.grub.menu.example"/>.

    <para>
     The naming convention &grub; uses for hard disks and partitions differ
     from that used for normal Linux devices. It more closely resembles the
     simple disk enumeration the BIOS does and the syntax is similar to that
     used in some BSD derivatives. In &grub;, the numbering of the
     partitions start with zero. This means that
     (<filename>hd0,0</filename>) is the first partition of the first hard
     disk. On a common desktop machine with a hard disk connected as primary
     master, the corresponding Linux device name is
     <filename>/dev/sda1</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The four possible primary partitions are assigned the partition numbers
     <literal>0</literal> to <literal>3</literal>. The logical partitions
     are numbered from <literal>4</literal>:
    </para>
<screen>(hd0,0)   first primary partition of the first hard disk
(hd0,1)   second primary partition
(hd0,2)   third primary partition
(hd0,3)   fourth primary partition (usually an extended partition)
(hd0,4)   first logical partition
(hd0,5)   second logical partition</screen>
    <para>
     Being dependent on BIOS devices, &grub; does not distinguish between
     PATA (IDE), SATA, SCSI, and hardware RAID devices. All hard disks
     recognized by the BIOS or other controllers are numbered according to
     the boot sequence preset in the BIOS.
    </para>
    <para>
     Unfortunately, it is often not possible to map the Linux device names
     to BIOS device names exactly. It generates this mapping with the help
     of an algorithm and saves it to the file
     <filename>device.map</filename>, which can be edited if necessary.
     Information about the file <filename>device.map</filename> is available
     in <xref linkend="sec.grub.map"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
     A complete &grub; path consists of a device name written in parentheses
     and the path to the file in the file system in the specified partition.
     The path begins with a slash. For example, the bootable kernel could be
     specified as follows on a system with a single PATA (IDE) hard disk
     containing Linux in its first partition:

     Editing menu entries facilitates the repair of a defective system that
     can no longer be booted, because the faulty configuration file of the

   <secondary>device.map</secondary></indexterm>
   <para>
    The file <filename>device.map</filename> maps &grub; and BIOS device
    names to Linux device names. In a mixed system containing PATA (IDE) and
    SCSI hard disks, &grub; must try to determine the boot sequence by a
    special procedure, because &grub; may not have access to the BIOS
    information on the boot sequence. &grub; saves the result of this
    analysis in the file <filename>/boot/grub/device.map</filename>. Example
    <filename>device.map</filename> files for a system on which the boot
    sequence in the BIOS is set to PATA before SCSI could look as follows:
   </para>
<screen>(fd0)  /dev/fd0
(hd0)  /dev/sda
(hd1)  /dev/sdb</screen>
   <para>
    or
   </para>
<screen>(fd0)  /dev/fd0
(hd0)  /dev/disk-by-id/<replaceable>DISK1 ID</replaceable>
(hd1)  /dev/disk-by-id/<replaceable>DISK2 ID</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    Because the order of PATA (IDE), SCSI and other hard disks depends on
    various factors and Linux is not able to identify the mapping, the
    sequence in the file <filename>device.map</filename> can be set
    manually. If you encounter problems when booting, check if the sequence
    in this file corresponds to the sequence in the BIOS and use the &grub;
    prompt to modify it temporarily, if necessary. After the Linux system
    has booted, the file <filename>device.map</filename> can be edited
    permanently with the &yast; boot loader module or an editor of your
    choice.
   </para>
   <note os="sles">
    <title>Maximum Number of Hard Disks</title>
    <para>
     To address a hard disk, &grub; uses BIOS services. This is done via the
     software interrupt Int13h. Since Int13h is limited to handling a
     maximum number of eight disks, &grub; can only boot from the disks
     handled by Int13h, even if there are more disks present (which is often
     the case on multipath systems). The <filename>device.map</filename>
     file created during the installation will therefore only contain a
     maximum number of the eight disks handled by Int13h.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    After manually changing <filename>device.map</filename>, execute the
    following command to reinstall &grub;. This command causes the file
    <filename>device.map</filename> to be reloaded and the commands listed

   <para>
    The third important &grub; configuration file after

<screen>setup --stage2=/boot/grub/stage2 --force-lba (hd0,1) (hd0,1)
   quit</screen>
   <para>
    This command tells &grub; to automatically install the boot loader to
    the second partition on the first hard disk (hd0,1) using the boot
    images located on the same partition. The
    <option>--stage2=/boot/grub/stage2</option> parameter is needed to
    install the <filename>stage2</filename> image from a mounted file
    system. Some BIOSes have a faulty LBA support implementation,
    <option>--force-lba</option> provides a solution to ignore them.

    <title>Bootloader Configuration after a Kernel Update</title>

     Every time a new kernel is installed, the perl bootloader writes a new

      Some operating systems, such as Windows, can only boot from the first
      hard disk. If such an operating system is installed on a hard disk
      other than the first hard disk, you can effect a logical change for
      the respective menu entry.
     </para>
<screen>...
title windows
   map (hd0) (hd1)
   map (hd1) (hd0)
   chainloader(hd1,0)+1
...</screen>
     <para>
      In this example, Windows is started from the second hard disk. For
      this purpose, the logical order of the hard disks is changed with
      <literal>map</literal>. This change does not affect the logic within
      the &grub; menu file. Therefore, the second hard disk must be
      specified for <literal>chainloader</literal>.
