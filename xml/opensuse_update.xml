   </indexterm> You can upgrade an existing system without completely
   reinstalling it. There are two types of renewing the system or parts of
   it: <emphasis>updating individual software packages</emphasis> and
   <emphasis>upgrading the entire system</emphasis>. Updating individual
   packages is covered in <xref linkend="cha.y2.sw"/> and
   <xref linkend="cha.onlineupdate.you"/>. Two ways to upgrade the system
   are discussed in the following sections&mdash; see
   <xref
    linkend="sec.upgrade.yast"/> and
   <xref linkend="sec.update.zypper"/>.

  <title>Upgrading the System</title>

  <para>
   Software tends to <quote>grow</quote> from version to version. Therefore,
   take a look at the available partition space with <command>df</command>
   before updating. If you suspect you are running short of disk space,
   secure your data before you update and repartition your system. There is
   no general rule regarding how much space each partition should have.
   Space requirements depend on your particular partitioning profile, the
   software selected, and the version numbers of the system.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.update.prep">
   <title>Preparations</title>
   <para>
    Before upgrading, copy the old configuration files to a separate medium
    (such as removable hard disk or USB flash drive) to secure the data.
    This primarily applies to files stored in <filename>/etc</filename> as
    well as some of the directories and files in <filename>/var</filename>.
    You may also want to write the user data in <filename>/home</filename>
    (the <envar>HOME</envar> directories) to a backup medium. Back up this
    data as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. Only
    <systemitem class="username"
     >root</systemitem> has read permission
    for all local files.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before starting your update, make note of the root partition. The
    command <command>df&nbsp;/</command> lists the device name of the root
    partition. In <xref
     linkend="aus.update.df"/>, the root partition
    to write down is <filename>/dev/sda3</filename> (mounted as
    <filename>/</filename>).

    If you upgrade a default system from the previous version to this
    version, &yast; works out the necessary changes and performs them.
    Depending on your customizations, some steps (or the entire upgrade
    procedure) may fail and you must resort to copying back your backup
    data. Check the following issues before starting the system update.

     Before upgrading the system, make sure that
     <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/group</filename> do
     not contain any syntax errors. For this purpose, start the verification
     utilities <command>pwck</command> and <command>grpck</command> as
     <systemitem
      class="username">root</systemitem> to eliminate any
     reported errors.

    Following the preparation procedure outlined in

    <step>
     <para>
      Boot the system as for the installation, described in
      <xref linkend="sec.i.yast2.start"
      />. In &yast;, choose a
      language and select <guimenu>Update</guimenu> in the
      <guimenu>Installation Mode</guimenu> dialog. Do not select
      <guimenu>New Installation</guimenu>. Also add repositories to make
      sure to get all available software updated whenever possible. Find
      more information about installation repositories in
      <xref
       linkend="sec.i.yast2.inst_mode.addon"/>.
     </para>

    <step>
     <para>
      &yast; determines if there are multiple root partitions. If there is
      only one, continue with the next step. If there are several, select
      the right partition and confirm with <guimenu>Next</guimenu>
      (<filename>/dev/sda3</filename> was selected in the example in
      <xref
       linkend="sec.update.prep"/>). &yast; reads the old
      <filename>fstab</filename> on this partition to analyze and mount the
      file systems listed there.
     </para>
     <warning>
      <title>Persistent Device Names</title>
      <para>
       All entries in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> that specify
       partitions to be mounted using the kernel-device name must be changed
       to any of the other supported methods prior to performing an update.
       Kernel-device names are not persistent and are therefore unreliable
       for use during the update process. This can be done using the &yast;
       System Partitioner by changing the method used in the fstab options
       settings.
      </para>

      Check the previously used repositories, if there are any. Enable all
      the repositories you still want to use and from where you want to
      update third-party software. Click the <guimenu>Toggle
      Status</guimenu> for every list item, if appropriate.
     </para>

      If you added repositories during the upgrade procedure as recommended
      above, you now can activate those you are actually interested in.

      In the <guimenu>Installation Settings</guimenu> dialog, adjust the
      settings according to your requirements. Normally, you can leave the
      default settings untouched. If you intend to enhance your system,
      however, check the packages and patterns offered in the
      <guimenu>Packages</guimenu> and <guimenu>Update Options</guimenu>
      submenus, or add support for additional languages.
     </para>
     <para>
      You also have the possibility to make backups of various system
      components. Selecting backups slows down the upgrade process. Use this
      option if you do not have a recent system backup.

      example, <guimenu>Update Based on Selection "Standard System with

   <title>Updating Individual Packages</title>
   <para>
    Regardless of your overall updated environment, you can always update
    individual packages. From this point on, however, it is your
    responsibility to ensure that your system remains consistent.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use the &yast; software management tool to update packages as described
    in <xref linkend="cha.y2.sw"/>. Select components from the &yast;
    package selection list according to your needs. If a newer version of a
    package exists, the version numbers of the installed and the available
    versions are listed in blue color in the <guimenu>Installed
    (Available)</guimenu> column. If you select a package essential for the
    overall operation of the system, &yast; issues a warning. Such packages
    should be updated only in the update mode. For example, many packages
    contain <emphasis>shared libraries</emphasis>. Updating these programs
    and applications in the running system may lead to system instability.

  <title>Software Changes</title>

  <para>
   The individual modifications from version to version are outlined in the
   following in detail. This summary indicates, for example, whether basic
   settings have been completely reconfigured, configuration files have been
   moved to other places, or common applications have been significantly
   changed. Significant modifications that affect the daily use of the
   system at either the user level or the administrator level are mentioned
   here.

   Problems and special issues of the various versions are published online
   as they are identified. See the links listed below. Important updates of
