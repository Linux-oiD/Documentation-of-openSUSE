     <para>
      If you enable para-virtualization by activating
      <guimenu>virtio</guimenu>, all hard disks you create will be
      configured as <systemitem>virtio</systemitem> disks. If your operating
      system does not have appropriate drivers, the installation will fail.
      A Windows operating system installation even fails if providing a
      driver. By default, this feature is only activated for operating
      systems known to ship with <systemitem>virtio</systemitem> drivers.
     </para>
     <para>
      Overwriting the default by activating para-virtualization for
      non-supported operating system currently only makes sense for &sls;

       <title>Sufficient Space for Sparse Image Files</title>
       <para>
        When creating sparse image files, the partition on which you create
        them always needs sufficient free space. The &vmguest; has no means
        to check the &vmhost; disk space. Having no space left on the host
        partition causes write errors and loss of data on the guest system.

    <para>
     For best performance, create each virtual disk from an entire disk or a
     partition. For the next best performance, create an image file but do
     not create it as a sparse image file. A virtual disk based on a sparse
     image file delivers the most disk space flexibility but slows
     installation and disk access speeds.

     <title>Live Migration</title>

      If you need to be able to migrate your &vmguest; to another host

      network resource (network file system or iSCSI volume) that is
      accessible from both hosts.

   <title>Adding para-virtualized Drivers During the Installation</title>
   <para>
    Installing an operating system out of the box on machines with
    para-virtualized devices is currently only possible with &sls; 11 SP1 or
    RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and newer. &novell; offers para-virtualized
    drivers for &sls; 10 SP3 and Windows operating systems, that can be
    installed manually.
   </para>
   <para>
    In case of &sls; 10 SP3 these drivers can be added at the start of the
    installation. Thus it is possible to install on a virtual machine with
    para-virtualized devices (hard disk, network adapter and memory
    ballooning). See <xref linkend="cha.kvm.inst.vmm.custom.hardware"/> on
    how to activate para-virtualization when setting up a virtual machine.
    Windows operating systems refuse to install on para-virtualized drives,
    even if adding the drivers during the installation. Therefore
    para-virtualization for Windows can only be activated in an already
    installed system.

    installing para-virtualized drivers in an already installed system.

     &sls; 10 SP3 does not support para-virtualized devices out of the box,
     because the drivers are not included. In order to use such devices, add
     the missing drivers during the installation. Proceed as follows:

       When setting up the &vmguest;, specify the ISO image containing the

   <title>Including Add-On Products in the Installation</title>
   <para>
    Some operating systems such as &sls; offer to include add-on products in
    the installation process. In case the add-on product installation source
    is provided via network, no special &vmguest; configuration is needed.
    If it is provided via CD/DVD or ISO image, it is necessary to provide
    the &vmguest; installation system with both, the standard installation
    images and the image for the add-on product.
   </para>
   <para>
    First add the standard installation image, and second the physical
    CD/DVD-ROM or add-on image. The image or device added first is
