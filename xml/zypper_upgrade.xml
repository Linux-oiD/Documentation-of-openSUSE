  With the <command>zypper</command> command line utility you can upgrade to
  the next version of the distribution. Most importantly, you can initiate
  the system upgrade process from within the running system.
 </para>
 <para>
  This feature is attractive for advanced users who want to run remote
  upgrades or upgrades on many similarly configured systems. Inexperienced
  users will prefer the upgrade with &yast; using a boot medium as described
  in <xref linkend="sec.upgrade.yast"/>.

  <title>Before Starting the Upgrade with zypper</title>

   Upgrade from the previous version (e.g., 11.3) to this version

  <title>The Upgrade Procedure</title>
  <warning>
   <title>Check Your System Backup</title>
   <para>
    Before actually starting the upgrade procedure, check that your system
    backup is up-to-date and restorable. This is especially important
    because you must enter many of the following steps manually.
   </para>
  </warning>
  <procedure>
   <step>

     Run the online update to make sure the software management stack is
     up-to-date. For more information, see

     Configure the repositories you want to use as an update source. Getting
     this right is essential. Either use &yast; (see
     <xref linkend="sec.y2.sw.instsource"/>) or <command>zypper</command>
     (see <xref linkend="sec.zypper"/>).

       Disable third party repositories or other openSUSE Build Service

       <title>Handling of Unresolved Dependencies</title>
       <para>
        <command>zypper dup</command> will remove all packages having
        unresolved dependencies, but it keeps packages of disabled
        repositories as long as their dependencies are satisfied.
       </para>
      </note>
      <para>
       <command>zypper dup</command> ensures that all installed packages
       come from one of the available repositories. It does not consider the
       version, architecture, or vendor of the installed packages; thus it
       emulates a fresh installation. Packages that are no longer available
       in the repositories are considered orphaned. Such packages get
       uninstalled if their dependencies can not be satisfied. If they can
       be satisfied, such packages stay installed.
