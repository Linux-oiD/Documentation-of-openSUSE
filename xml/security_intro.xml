  This manual introduces the basic concepts of system security on
  &productname;. It covers extensive documentation about the authentication
  mechanisms available on Linux, such as NIS or LDAP. It also deals with
  aspects of local security like access control lists, encryption and
  intrusion detection. In the network security part you learn how to secure
  your computers with firewalls and masquerading, and how to set up virtual
  private networks (VPN). This manual also shows you how to make use of the
  product's inherent security software like &naa; (which lets you specify
  per program which files the program may read, write, and
  execute)<phrase os="sles;sled"> or the auditing system that reliably
  collects information about any security-relevant events</phrase>.
