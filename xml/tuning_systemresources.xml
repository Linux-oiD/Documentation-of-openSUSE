 <title>General System Resource Management</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Tuning the system is not only about optimizing the kernel or getting the
   most out of your application, it begins with setting up a lean and fast
   system. The way you set up your partitions and file systems can influence
   the servers speed. The number of active services and the way routine
   tasks are scheduled also affects performance.

 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.resources.installation">
  <title>Planning the Installation</title>

  <para>
   A carefully planned installation ensures that the system is basically set
   up exactly as you need it for the given purpose. It also saves
   considerable time when fine tuning the system. All changes suggested in
   this section can be made in the <guimenu>Installation Settings</guimenu>
   step during the installation. See <xref linkend="sec.i.yast2.proposal"/>
   for details.

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.resources.installation.partitioning">
   <title>Partitioning</title>
   <para>
    Depending on the server's range of application and the hardware layout
    the partitioning scheme can influence the machine's performance
    (although to a lesser extend only). It is beyond the scope of this
    manual to suggest different partion schemes for particular workloads,
    however, the following rules will positively affect performance. Of
    course they do not apply when using an external storage system.

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.resources.installation.scope">
   <title>Installation Scope</title>
   <para>
    Actually, the installation scope has no direct influence on the
    machine's performance, but a carefully chosen scope of packages
    nevertheless has got advantages. It is recommended to install the
    minimum of packages needed to run the server. A system with a minimum
    set of packages is easier to mainatain and has got less potential
    security issues. Furthermore, a tailor made installation scope also
    ensures no unnecessary services are started by default.
   </para>
   <para>
    &productname; lets you customize the installation scope on the
    Installation Summary screen. By default, you can select or remove
    preconfigured patterns for specific tasks, but it is also possible to
    start the &yast; Software Manager for a fine-grained package based
    selection.
   </para>
   <para>
    One or more of the following patterns selected for installation by
    default may not be needed in all cases:

     <term>GNOME Desktop Environment</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A server seldomly needs a full-blown desktop environment. In case a
       graphical environment is needed, a more economical solution such as
       as icewm or fvwm may also be sufficient.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       When solely administrating the server and its applications via
       command line, consider to not install this pattern. However, keep in
       mind that it is needed to run GUI applications from a remote machine.
       If your application is managed by a GUI or if you prefer the GUI
       version of &yast;, keep this pattern.

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.resources.installation.runlevel">
   <title>Default Runlevel</title>
   <para>
    A running X Window system eats up many ressources and is seldomly needed
    on a server. It is strongly recommended to start the system in runlevel
    3 (Full multi-user with network, no X). You will still be able to start
    graphical applications from remote or use the <command>startx</command>
    command to start a local graphical desktop.

 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.resources.services">
  <title>Disabling Unnecessary Services</title>

  <para>
   The default installation starts a number of services (the number varies
   with the installation scope). Since each service consumes ressources, it
   is recommended to disable the ones not needed. Start <menuchoice>
   <guimenu>&yast;</guimenu> <guimenu>System</guimenu>
   <guimenu>&ycc_runlevel;</guimenu> <guimenu>Expert Mode</guimenu>
   </menuchoice> to start the services management module. When using the
   graphical version of &yast; you can click on the column headlines to sort
   the service list. Use this to get an overview of which services are
   currently running or which services are started in the server's default
   runlevel. Mark a service with the mouse to see its description. Use the
   <guimenu>Start/Stop/Refresh</guimenu> dropdown to disable the service for
   the running session. To permanently disable it, use the
   <guimenu>Set/Reset</guimenu> drop-down.

 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.resources.disk">
  <title>File Systems and Disk Access</title>

  <para>
   Hard disks are the slowest components in a computer system and therefore
   often the cause for a bottleneck. Using the file system that best suits
   your workload helps to improve performance. Using special mount options
   or prioritizing a process' I/O priority are further means to speed up the
   system.

    <title>NFS</title>
    <para>
     NFS (Version 3) tuning is covered in detail in the NFS Howto at
     <ulink
      url="http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/"/>. The first
     thing you should experiment with when mounting NFS shares is increasing
     the read write blocksize to 32768 by using the mount options
     <option>wsize</option> and <option>rsize</option>.

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.resources.disk.mount">
   <title>Disabling Access Time (atime) Updates</title>
   <para>
    Whenever a file is read on a Linux file system, its access time (atime)
    is updated. As a result, each read-only file access in fact causes a
    write. On a journaling file system it is even two write operations since
    the journal will be updated, too. It is recommended to turn this feature
    off when you do not need to keep track of access times. This is possibly
    true for file and Web servers as well as for a netwok storage.
   </para>
   <para>
    To turn off access time updates, mount the file system with the
    <option>noatime</option> option. To do so, either edit
    <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> directly, or use the <guimenu>Fstab
    Options</guimenu> dialog when editing or adding a partition with the
    &yast; Partitioner.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.resources.disk.ionice">
   <title>Prioritizing Disk Access with <command>ionice</command></title>
   <para>
    The <command>ionice</command> command lets you prioritize disk access
    for single processes. This enables you to give less I/O priority to non
    time-critical background processes with heavy disk access such as backup
    jobs. On the other hand <command>ionice</command> lets you raise I/O
    priority for a specific process to make sure this process has always
    immediate access to the disk. You may set the following three scheduling
    classes:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Idle</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A process from the idle scheduling class is only granted disk access,
       when no other process has asked for disk I/O.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Best effort</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       By default, every process will be granted I/O priority from this
       class. Priority within this class can be adjusted to a level from 0
       to 7 (with 0 being the highest priority). By default, a process will
       be granted a priority corresponding to their CPU nice level.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Real-time</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Processes in this class are always granted disk access first.
       Fine-tune the priority level from 0 to 7 (with 0 being the highest
       priority). Use with care, since it can starve other processes.
