   Although it is possible to repartition your system while it is running,

   <para>
    On the IBM &zseries; platforms, &sls; supports SCSI hard disks as well
    as DASDs (direct access storage devices). While SCSI disks can be
    partitioned as described below, DASDs can have no more than three
    partition entries in their partition tables.

   Every hard disk has a partition table with space for four entries. Every
   entry in the partition table corresponds to a primary partition or an
   extended partition. Only one extended partition entry is allowed,
   however.
  </para>
  <para>
   A primary partition simply consists of a continuous range of cylinders
   (physical disk areas) assigned to a particular operating system. With
   primary partitions you would be limited to four partitions per hard disk,
   because more do not fit in the partition table. This is why extended
   partitions are used. Extended partitions are also continuous ranges of
   disk cylinders, but an extended partition may be divided into
   <emphasis>logical partitions</emphasis> itself. Logical partitions do not
   require entries in the partition table. In other words, an extended
   partition is a container for logical partitions.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you need more than four partitions, create an extended partition as
   the fourth partition (or earlier). This extended partition should occupy
   the entire remaining free cylinder range. Then create multiple logical
   partitions within the extended partition. The maximum number of logical
   partitions is 15 on SCSI, SATA, and Firewire disks and 63 on (E)IDE
   disks. It does not matter which types of partitions are used for Linux.
   Primary and logical partitions both function normally.

   <title>Using <literal>swap</literal></title>
   <para>
    Swap is used to extend the available physical memory. It is then
    possible to use more memory than physical RAM available. The memory
    management system of kernels before 2.4.10 needed swap as a safety
    measure. Then, if you did not have twice the size of your RAM in swap,
    the performance of the system suffered. These limitations no longer
    exist.
   </para>
   <para>
    Linux uses a page called <quote>Least Recently Used</quote> (LRU) to
    select pages that might be moved from memory to disk. Therefore, running
    applications have more memory available and caching works more smoothly.

       The application gets the maximum allowed memory. All caches are
       freed, and thus all other running applications are slowed. After a
       few minutes, the kernel's out-of-memory kill mechanism activates and
       kills the process.

       physical RAM has been allocated, swap space is used as well. At this
       point, the system becomes very slow and it becomes impossible to run
       commands from remote. Depending on the speed of the hard disks that
       run the swap space, the system stays in this condition for about 10
       to 15 minutes until the out-of-memory kill mechanism resolves the
       issue. Note that you will need a certain amount of swap if the
       computer needs to perform a <quote>suspend to disk</quote>. In that
       case, the swap size should be large enough to contain the necessary
       data from memory (512 MB&ndash;1GB).

       It is better to not have an application that is out of control and

       system will need many hours to recover. In the process, it is likely
       that other processes get timeouts and faults, leaving the system in
       an undefined state, even after killing the faulty process. In this
       case, do a hard machine reboot and try to get it running again. Lots
       of swap is only useful if you have an application that relies on this
       feature. Such applications (like databases or graphics manipulation
       programs) often have an option to directly use hard disk space for
       their needs. It is advisable to use this option instead of using lots

    If your system is not out of control, but needs more swap after some
    time, it is possible to extend the swap space online. If you prepared a
    partition for swap space, just add this partition with &yast;. If you do
    not have a partition available, you may also just use a swap file to
    extend the swap. Swap files are generally slower than partitions, but
    compared to physical ram, both are extremely slow so the actual
    difference is negligible.

    <title>Adding a Swap File Manually</title>
    <para>
     To add a swap file in the running system, proceed as follows:
    </para>
    <step>
     <para>
      Create an empty file in your system. For example, if you want to add a
      swap file with 128&nbsp;MB swap at
      <filename>/var/lib/swap/swapfile</filename>, use the commands:
     </para>
<screen>mkdir -p /var/lib/swap
dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/swap/swapfile bs=1M count=128</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Initialize this swap file with the command
     </para>
<screen>mkswap /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Activate the swap with the command
     </para>
<screen>swapon /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
     <para>
      To disable this swap file, use the command
     </para>
<screen>swapoff /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Check the current available swap spaces with the command
     </para>
<screen>cat /proc/swaps</screen>
     <para>
      Note that at this point, it is only temporary swap space. After the
      next reboot, it is no longer utilized.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      To enable this swap file permanently, add the following line to
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:
     </para>
     <remark>mdejmek: is it really ".... swap swap defaults..."? Just to make sure it's not a typo :) </remark>
     <remark>bg: yes it is.</remark>
<screen>/var/lib/swap/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0</screen>

  <title>Partitioning and LVM</title>
  <para>
   From the <guimenu>Expert partitioner</guimenu>, access the LVM
   configuration by clicking the <guimenu>Volume Management</guimenu> item
   in the <guimenu>System View</guimenu> pane.
<!-- (see
   FIXME: link to storage guide <xref linkend="sec.yast2.i_y2_part_expert"/>) -->
   However, if a working LVM configuration already exists on your system, it
   is automatically activated upon entering the initial LVM configuration of
   a session. In this case, all disks containing a partition (belonging to
   an activated volume group) cannot be repartitioned. The Linux kernel
   cannot reread the modified partition table of a hard disk when any
   partition on this disk is in use. However, if you already have a working
   LVM configuration on your system, physical repartitioning should not be
   necessary. Instead, change the configuration of the logical volumes.
  </para>
  <para>
   At the beginning of the physical volumes (PVs), information about the
   volume is written to the partition. To reuse such a partition for other
   non-LVM purposes, it is advisable to delete the beginning of this volume.
   For example, in the VG <literal>system</literal> and PV
   <filename>/dev/sda2</filename>, do this with the command
   <command>dd</command>&nbsp;<option>if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512
   count=1</option>.
  </para>
  <warning>
   <title>File System for Booting</title>
   <para>
    The file system used for booting (the root file system or
    <filename>/boot</filename>) must not be stored on an LVM logical volume.
    Instead, store it on a normal physical partition.
   </para>
