 <para>
  Some home users do not have a dedicated line connecting them to the
  Internet. Instead, they use dial-up connections. Depending on the dial-up
  method (ISDN or DSL), the connection is controlled by ipppd or pppd.
  Basically, all that needs to be done to go online is to start these
  programs correctly.
 </para>

 <para>
  If you have a flat-rate connection that does not generate any additional
  costs for the dial-up connection, simply start the respective daemon.
  Control the dial-up connection with a desktop applet or a command-line
  interface. If the Internet gateway is not the host you are using, you
  might want to control the dial-up connection by way of a network host.
 </para>

 <para>
  This is where smpppd (SUSE Meta PPP Daemon) is involved. It provides a
  uniform interface for auxiliary programs and acts in two directions.
  First, it programs the required pppd or ipppd and controls its dial-up
  properties. Second, it makes various providers available to the user
  programs and transmits information about the current status of the
  connection. As smpppd can also be controlled by way of the network, it is
  suitable for controlling dial-up connections to the Internet from a
  workstation in a private subnetwork.

  <title>Configuring smpppd</title>
  <para>
   The connections provided by smpppd are automatically configured by
   &yast;. The actual dial-up programs KInternet and cinternet are also
   preconfigured. Manual settings are only required to configure additional
   features of smpppd such as remote control.
  </para>
  <para>
   The configuration file of smpppd is
   <filename>/etc/smpppd.conf</filename>. By default, it does not enable
   remote control. The most important options of this configuration file
   are:

     <para>
      To control smpppd via the network, set this option to
      <literal>yes</literal>. smpppd listens on port
      <literal>3185</literal>. If this parameter is set to
      <literal>yes</literal>, the parameters
      <literal>bind-address</literal>, <literal>host-range</literal> and
      <literal>password</literal> must be set accordingly.

      If a host has several IP addresses, use this parameter to determine at
      which IP address smpppd should accept connections. The default is to
      listen at all addresses.

     <para>
      The parameter <literal>host-range</literal> defines a network range.
      Hosts whose IP addresses are within this range are granted access to
      smpppd. All hosts not within this range are denied access.

     <para>
      By assigning a password, limit the clients to authorized hosts. As
      this is a plain-text password, you should not overrate the security it
      provides. If no password is assigned, all clients are permitted to
      access smpppd.

  <para>
   qinternet can be used to control a local or remote smpppd. cinternet is
   the command-line counterpart to the graphical KInternet. To prepare these
   utilities for use with a remote smpppd, edit the configuration file
   <filename>/etc/smpppd-c.conf</filename> manually or using qinternet. This
   file only uses four options:
