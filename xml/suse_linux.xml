 <title>Special System Features</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   This chapter starts with information about various software packages, the
   virtual consoles and the keyboard layout. We talk about software
   components like <systemitem class="resource">bash</systemitem>,
   <systemitem
   class="resource">cron</systemitem> and
   <systemitem
   class="resource">logrotate</systemitem>, because they were
   changed or enhanced during the last release cycles. Even if they are
   small or considered of minor importance, users may want to change their
   default behavior, because these components are often closely coupled with
   the system. The chapter concludes with a section about language and
   country-specific settings (I18N and L10N).
