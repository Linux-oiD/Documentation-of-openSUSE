Making Autobuild Packages
*************************

It is a two-step procedure to submit a doc package to the Build Service
(internal or external):

  . First, create the PDF, HTML, .desktop and source files and write the
    .spec file using buildbook and book.spec.in coming with the
    susedoc-buildbook package.  This process it controlled by the book
    specific DEF-* files.

  . Second, check the .changes file and send a submitreq.


Find openSUSE 11.1 and 11.2 related information below.
For SLE10 SP3 look up the SLE_100 branch.
For SLE11, SLE11 SP1, and SLEHA11 look up the SLE_110. (Also see below.)

   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Prereq: Install susedoc-buildbook from the openSUSE:Factory project |
   |         (OBS, external BS).                                         |
   |         Sources:                                                    |
   |         https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/opensuse-doc.          |
   |                                                                     |
   |         You now need version 0.12 or better.                        |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

     OBS:    You need an openSUSE Build Service (OBS) account and
             the osc command-line interface must be working.  Call these
             commands and save the encrypted OBS password in ~/.obsrc
             (replace $USERNAME with your account name):

             osc mkpac home:$USERNAME test
             osc meta pkg -e home:$USERNAME test
             osc rdelete home:$USERNAME test

     IBS:    See OBS, and address the internal server at
             https://api.suse.de:

             osc -A https://api.suse.de mkpac home:$USERNAME test
             etc.


openSUSE
========

The following applies basically for 11.3.
11.2 stuff is in the OS_112 branch.


Building the books
------------------

Go to the SVN checkout directory, then call:

. ENV-opensuse-all
svn up
make update

    buildbook -d DEF-opensuse-manuals -n opensuse-manuals


The first time you call it after a fresh checkout, the following error
message may occur:

tar: html/opensuse-kdeuser/index.html: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: html/opensuse-kdeuser/index.html: Cannot stat: No such file or directory
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
make: *** [dist-html] Error 2

Calling it a second time, it succeeds.  Or source any ENV-* file.


Background Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The buildbook script calls special build targets such as "make
package", "make package-html", or "make package-pdf".  You will find the
result of these targets in the package directories such as "package-",
"package-html-", or "package-pdf-" with the book name or product name
appended: "package-pdf-opensuse-startup".

Depending on the output format, the package directory contains the
following files or a subset of them:

opensuse-startup_en-desktop.tar.bz2    - desktop files for KDE help center
opensuse-startup_en-graphics.tar.bz2   - image source files (screen shots)
opensuse-startup_en-html.tar.bz2       - HTML output
opensuse-startup_en-pdf-yelp.tar.bz2   - document file for GNOME help
                                         center (yelp).  Access to the PDF
opensuse-startup_en-yelp.tar.bz2       - document file for GNOME help
                                         center (yelp).  Access to HTML
opensuse-startup_en.pdf                - PDF
opensuse-startup_en.tar.bz2            - profiled XML sources


~ *** Check this!
The buildbook wrapper script then creates a suitable .spec file.

~Then it copies all this stuff plus the old .changes file to the
~autobuild directory and finally to a directory with a normalized
~name matching the book title (for example, opensuse-manuals_en).  All
~this a driven by a DEF file.

Internally, the script does the following

~ *** Check it!
OBSUSER=keichwa             # use your BS account!
PACKAGE=opensuse-manuals_en
osc branch openSUSE\:Factory $PACKAGE
osc checkout home:$OBSUSER:branches:openSUSE:Factory/$PACKAGE

# now copy the new stuff into 
# home:$OBSUSER:branches:openSUSE:Factory/$PACKAGE
cd home:$OBSUSER:branches:openSUSE:Factory/$PACKAGE

update .changes

# commit it

    osc commit -m "Updated context."

### Manual action required!
# Send a submitreq to the Factory maintainer:

    osc submitreq -m 'Updated context.' \
      home:$OBSUSER:branches:openSUSE:Factory \
      $PACKAGE openSUSE:Factory

Building Localized Manual Packages
==================================

Use the -e|--extdir option to pull in package files built externally
(e.g., in Dublin by calling "make package").  If you re-use the English
infrastructure, specify the wanted language with the -l|--lang option.
Examples:

opensuse-manuals_de (in the 'de' directory of the SVN):

../../novdoc/bin/buildbook-for-obs.sh -d DEF-opensuse-manuals \
  -n opensuse-manual -l de

If you want to reuse an external PDF (change to the 'en' directory
first!):

../../novdoc/bin/buildbook-for-obs.sh -d DEF-SLES-admin -n sles-admin \
  -l de -e .../sles-admin_de


Instead of .../sles-admin_de or .../sled-kde-user_de use the directory
where the files are stored.

SLEPOS
======

svn up
make update

buildbook -d DEF-SLEPOS-guide -n slepos-guide

Submit to ibs://Devel:SLEPOS:SLE-11-POS-SP1

Old package names: SLEPOS and slepos-united_en-pdf
slepos-install
slepos-admin


SLMS
====

buildbook -d DEF-SLE-slms-manual -n sle-slms-manual

and submit with the "osc sr" as printed at the of the buildbook
process.


WebYaST
=======

GFDL'ed, thus it lives in OBS.

buildbook -d DEF-webyast-vendor -n webyast-vendor
buildbook -d DEF-webyast-user -n webyast-user

Submit to obs://YaST:Web (where ke is a maintainer) and do a submitreq

SLEHA
=====

Build it from https://svn.suse.de/svn/doc/branches/SLE_11_HAE (for GA)
or from trunk (ask the writers where to find the files).

../../novdoc/bin/buildbook -d DEF-SLE-ha -n sleha-guide

Submit to /work/src/done/SLE11-PRODUCTS

submitpac -d -r sle11-products sleha-guide_en

For maintenance update (Swamp-ID is 26408, tracker bug is 529124) 
it was built from trunk.  And submitted it to Devel:HAE:SLE11 (IBS).
